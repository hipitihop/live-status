Description=Live Status detect video & microphone use.
# To run as a service, copy the live-status.sh to /usr/sbin or
# comparable path on your distro.
#
# NOTE:
#  When run as a service, only the video detection works, not microphone.
#  Microphone detection uses "pactl" to detect use and this needs to run
#  as user, and services run as root/sudo.
#  If this limitation does not effect you, then you are fine to run it as a
#  service. Alternately, setup the live-status.sh as a start app.
